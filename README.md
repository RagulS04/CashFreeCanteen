# Canteen Management System

The Cash Free Canteen is a web-based application designed to streamline the ordering process for students and simplify food item management for canteen staff. Students can place orders, which are then updated in the database for processing. Canteen staff have access to an admin panel where they can manage food item availability, recharge student accounts, and ensure efficient canteen operations.
